# Digitale Dörfer - mobile people’s bus system

This project deals with the development of a mobile people’s bus system. The system consists of a mobile app that serves as the people’s bus host system, another mobile app for citizens to use the different people’s busses and a server for interconnection of the two Apps. It is intended that the system will be used within the project [Digitale Dörfer](http://www.digitale-doerfer.de).

## Server ##

This repository contains the source code for the server which communicates with both the [Citizen Mobile APP](https://github.com/GSE-Project/SS2016-group2) and the [BusDriveApp](https://github.com/GSE-Project/SS2016-group3).

Implementation follows the framework of the [Open Application Standard Platform for Java (OASP4J)](http://oasp.github.io/oasp4j/oasp4j_overview.html).
