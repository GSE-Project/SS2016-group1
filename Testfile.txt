Closing an issue in the same repository

To close an issue in the same repository, use one of the keywords in the list below followed by a reference to the issue number in the commit message. For example, a commit message with Fixes #45 will close issue 45 in that repository once the commit is merged into the default branch.

If the commit is in a non-default branch, the issue will remain open and the issue will be referenced with a tooltip.

Keywords for closing issues

The following keywords will close an issue via commit message:

close
closes
closed
fix
fixes
fixed
resolve
resolves
resolved
Closing an issue in a different repository

To close an issue in another repository, use the username/repository#issue_number syntax, as described in "Autolinked references and URLs".

For example, including Closes example_user/example_repo#76 will close the referenced issue in that repository, provided you have push access to that repository.

Closing multiple issues

To close multiple issues, preface each issue reference with one of the above keywords.

For example, This closes #34, closes #23, and closes example_user/example_repo#42 would close issues #34 and #23 in the same repository, and issue #42 in the "example_user/example_repo" repository.
